## Solution

The title is "Breaking Bad" referring to the show, which involves chemistry. Because of this, chemistry deals with the [Periodic Table](https://sciencenotes.org/periodic-table-charges-118-elements/). Each of the symbols above correspond to a symbol in the table. Each element corresponds to a number within the table as well. We can take those numbers and put them in a list like this:

```
67 104 51 109 49 115 116 114 89 95 49 115 95 52 68 100 49 67 116 105 86 101
```

My first thought of what these numbers represented was decimal in the [ASCII Table](http://www.asciitable.com). Using the table, I was able to decode the flag.


## Flag
